Testing
The website is tested on:
Both a MacBook and PC;
Multiple browsers, including safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome;
iPhone 7 and iPad 2018 screen sizes with the testing outcome below:

All dog tiles are shown
  - all dog tiles are showing accordingly in response to different screen sizes, showing 1 tiles
  at smaller screen, 2 tiles on medium screen, 3 tiles on larger screen, and also only include
  the blog paragraph on larger screen.
  - the font size, styles and color are matched in between different systems.

Alignment
  - On smaller screen (smaller than 576px), on the index page, the image and the intro paragraph
  on top is not align with the header and the footer, it exceeded to the right side. The solution
  is to change the left side and right side padding in css, and also make sure use media query
  on smaller screen (max-width: 768px), so the right side blog paragraph does not show up on
  smaller screen.
  - on the blog page and form page, again the image exceeded to the right side in compares to the
  header and footer, use css padding to adjust the left and right side.

Hover, Alert, Clickable
  - all the alert, hover and click are working on all browsers, devices and screens.

Font size, styles, colors
  - on the contact page, the address and phone number are align vertically on smaller screen
  (max-width 576px), added a media query with no padding, so the paragraph is showing horizontally.

Others
  - the form data is console.log
  - use media query for printing without header image
  - gradient behind the header is working

Graceful Degradation
  - the site is built on a MacBook first, and use media query to make adjustment on mobile device.

PC
  - everything is functional
  - PC is a larger screen in compares to MacBook, so it has more white space in between each
  section

Conclusion:
The website works accordingly with each browsers, operation systems, and screen sizes with a
typical breakpoints.
